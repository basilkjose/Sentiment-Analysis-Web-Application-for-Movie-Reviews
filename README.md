## Overview
This is a simple NLP flask model trained on the imdb dataset for movie sentiment analyzing.
When a user submits a review the app should use the sklearn model trained on the IMDB
dataset to classify the review as positive or negative . The results should be returned to the user  and the result should
display the prediction as either positive or negative.All the movie reviews submitted by users should be stored in a SQLite database together with
the prediction (if it was a positive or negative review).

## Data_preprocessing
Text preprocessing is traditionally an important step for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It transforms text into a more digestible form so that machine learning algorithms can perform better.In this problem we done following types of preprocessing.
 * Removing all urls from data.
 * Removing all tags from data
 * Decontracting the words
 * Removing special character from data
 * Removing stop words
 * Stemming and Lemmatization
 * Tf-idf vectorization
