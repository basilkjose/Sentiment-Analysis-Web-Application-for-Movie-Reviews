## Overview
This is a simple NLP flask model trained on the imdb dataset for movie sentiment analyzing.
When a user submits a review the app should use the sklearn model trained on the IMDB
dataset to classify the review as positive or negative . The results should be returned to the user  and the result should
display the prediction as either positive or negative.All the movie reviews submitted by users should be stored in a SQLite database together with
the prediction (if it was a positive or negative review).

## Data Preprocessing
Text preprocessing is traditionally an important step for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It transforms text into a more digestible form so that machine learning algorithms can perform better.In this problem we done following types of preprocessing.
 * Removing all urls from data.
 * Removing all tags from data
 * Decontracting the words
 * Removing special character from data
 * Removing stop words
 * Stemming and Lemmatization
 * Tf-idf vectorization
 
##  Modeling
Imdb dataset is trained mainly on 3 machine learning models
* Logistic Regression
* Navie Bayes
* Support Vector Machine

we got maximum accuracy in the support vector machine, almost 89%.

## Technical Aspect
This project is divided into two part:

1) Training imdb dataset using machine learning models
2) Deployement of model

* For training purposes, we use sklrean library.
* For deployment, we use Flask and Heroku.
* We also database for storing the input and prediction value
